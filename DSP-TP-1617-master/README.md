## Labs descriptions
**Note: This lab is marked !!**

I will try to cover this lab in python and matlab both.
I prefer you use python, so you can practice it, however you can perform the lab in matlab as well. 

You have to fork the repository on your personal folder and at the end of each session you should push your activities to your repository on your personal github page.

I will check your codes and answers after each session and evaluate your lab.

## Some git comments:
* Getting my updates: 
	`git fetch origin`
* Adding and commiting your practice:
	`git add --all`
	`git commit -m 'your message'`
* Pushing your commit to your repository 
	`git push origin/master`
